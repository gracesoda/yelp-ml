# Yelp Dataset: Predicting User Reviews of New Restaurants
Yelp is a popular business review site that is commonly used by food enthusiasts to review the restaurants they visit, give recommendations, and discover new places to visit. I frequent Yelp as I enjoy exploring new restaurants in my area and want to make sure that others have left a positive review there, however I noticed a severe lack in user recommendations. Most of the time, when I search for a specific cuisine that I’m craving, it only sorts the results by the business’s average review, without considering the restaurants I’ve reviewed highly in the past that may be similar. I decided to use machine learning methods to recommend restaurants to users based on what types of restaurants they have previously reviewed positively.
